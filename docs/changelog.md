# New Haven Gaming Bot — Changelog

---

## Session — March 21, 2026

### `/highlow` — Stateless Game (Bot-Restart Proof)

The High or Low game no longer stores active games in bot memory. The shown number and the player's user ID are now encoded directly into each button's ID, so the game survives bot restarts and deployments without any state loss. As a side effect, the game's buttons now only respond to the member who started it — other members cannot click your game.

---

### `/balance` — Removed User Lookup

`/balance` no longer accepts a `@user` option. It now only shows your own wallet, bank, and total. Members who want to check someone else's wallet can use `/spy` (requires a Spy item from the shop).

---

### Shop Management — Restricted to Bot Owner

`/shopedit` and `/shopremove` were previously gated on **Manage Guild** permission. Both are now restricted to the **bot owner only**, matching `/shopadd`. Only the bot owner can add, edit, or remove shop items.

---

### Owner-Only Check Hardened Across All Commands

All bot-owner-restricted commands (`/coins`, `/addvoicetime`, `/shopadd`, `/shopedit`, `/shopremove`) previously used a live Discord API call to look up the application owner at runtime — which could silently fail. All five commands now use a hardcoded owner ID check that is instant and always reliable.

---

## Session — March 20, 2026 (continued)

### Shop Price Adjustments

Rebalanced the robbery shop items for better economy fairness:

| Item | Old Price | New Price |
|---|---|---|
| Rob Shield | 🪙 500 | 🪙 500 (unchanged) |
| Lockpick | 🪙 200 | 🪙 600 |
| Spy | 🪙 400 | 🪙 250 |

The Lockpick price was raised so bypassing a Rob Shield costs at least as much as placing one. The Spy price was lowered to encourage use — checking a wallet is useful info but not powerful enough to justify a near-daily cost.

---

### `/roleadd` — Multi-Role & All Members Support

`/roleadd` has been expanded significantly:

- **Up to 5 roles at once** — `role1` through `role5` (role1 is required, the rest are optional). All roles are validated against bot and caller hierarchy before any are applied.
- **All members** — set `all_members: True` to apply every selected role to the entire server. The bot fetches all members, skips anyone who already has all the roles, and posts a summary embed showing how many were updated, skipped, and failed.
- **Bulk summary embed** — when applying to all members, the reply shows updated / skipped / failed counts instead of a per-member breakdown.

---

### `/post` — Management Footer

All three post types (`/post update`, `/post announce`, `/post botupdates`) now show a fixed footer on every embed:

- **Icon** — the avatar of whoever ran the command
- **Text** — `Management: {their server display name}`

The optional footer text field has been removed from the modal — the footer is now set automatically. The modal now has three fields: Title, Body, and Image URL.

---

## v2.0.0 — March 20, 2026

The bot has been bumped to **version 2.0.0** to reflect the scale of changes made since launch. The command count grew from a loose collection of commands to a structured system of **89 slash commands**. Major systems added include a full economy overhaul (bank, robbery, jail, shop items), Custom Voice Channels (21 subcommands), pets, poker, horse racing, bank robbery, and a complete moderation suite. The music system was trialled and removed due to platform limitations.

`/bot info` now shows **v2.0.0**.

---

## Session — March 20, 2026

### Jail System

Getting caught during a `/rob` now sends you to jail for a random **15–30 minutes**. While in jail every coin-earning command is locked: `/rob`, `/crime`, `/bankrob`, `/work`, `/daily`, `/weekly`, `/monthly`, `/beg`, `/fish`, `/hunt`, `/mine`, `/sell`, `/sellall`, and all gambling commands. The failed rob embed shows a Discord timestamp for your exact release time. Viewing your balance, depositing, withdrawing, shopping, and buying still work normally.

---

### Rob Notifications (DMs)

The victim of a rob attempt now always receives a DM:
- **Successful rob** — told who robbed them and how many coins were taken
- **Failed rob** — told who tried and how much compensation they received
- **Shield blocked** — told whose attempt was blocked and that the shield was consumed

DMs fail gracefully if the victim has them closed — no errors are thrown.

---

### Lockpick — New Shop Item (🪙 600)

A **Lockpick** can be bought from the shop. When using `/rob`, an optional `lockpick:true` flag appears. If the target has a Rob Shield and you have a Lockpick and set the flag, the lockpick is consumed and the shield is bypassed — the rob proceeds normally. Without the flag (or without a lockpick), the shield blocks as normal.

---

### Spy — New Shop Item & Command (🪙 250)

A **Spy** item can be bought from the shop. Using `/spy <user>` consumes the item and reveals the target's current wallet balance in an ephemeral reply only you can see. Works on any member; cannot target yourself or bots.

---

### Robbery Leaderboard — `/roblb`

A new `/roblb` command shows two leaderboards side-by-side:
- **Top Robbers** — ranked by total coins stolen across all successful robs
- **Most Robbed** — ranked by number of times successfully robbed

Stats are tracked persistently in `data/robstats.json` and accumulate across bot restarts.

---

### `/balance` — Rob Shield Indicator

If you (or the user you're checking) have a **Rob Shield** in your inventory, `/balance` now shows **🛡️ Rob Shield active** next to your name in the embed.

---

### `/shopmove` — Reorder Shop Items

A new `/shopmove <item> <position>` command lets staff move any shop item to a specific position in the list without having to remove and re-add it. Requires **Manage Server** permission.

---

### Bank System — `/deposit` & `/withdraw`

Your coin balance is now split into two pockets:
- **Wallet** — at risk from `/rob`
- **Bank** — completely safe; thieves cannot touch it

Use `/deposit <amount>` to move coins into the bank and `/withdraw <amount|all>` to pull them back out. The `/balance` command shows both values plus a combined total.

---

## Session — March 19, 2026

### Custom Voice Channels (`/vc`)

A full custom voice channel system has been added. Members purchase a **Custom VC** from the shop and receive a permanent voice channel they manage themselves using 20 subcommands under a single `/vc` command.

**Key features:**
- VC persists when empty — members buy once and keep it indefinitely
- Owner gets **Priority Speaker** automatically; transfers with `/vc transfer`
- Privacy modes: **public** (anyone can join) or **private** (everyone can see the channel but only guests can join)
- VC-only mute and ban — no server impact whatsoever
- Guestlist and blacklist with per-user Discord permission overwrites
- Admin setup via `/vc setup category: <category>` to control where VCs are created

See the [Custom Voice Channels](custom-vc.md) page for the full command reference.

---

### Voice Time — Weekly Reset Changed to Sunday Midnight EST

The weekly voice time counter now resets every **Sunday at midnight Eastern Time**, replacing the old rolling 7-day window. The reset is DST-aware (adjusts automatically between EST and EDT).

---

### `/vc invite` — Now Adds Member to Channel Permissions

`/vc invite <user>` no longer generates a Discord invite URL. It now adds the specified member directly to the voice channel's Advanced Permissions (granting `ViewChannel` and `Connect`), identical to `/vc add`. The member is also saved to the guestlist so they retain access if the channel is set to private.

---

### `/buy` — Custom VC Naming on Purchase

When buying a **Custom VC** from the shop, members can now set the channel name directly in the buy command using the optional `channel-name` field. If skipped, the channel is named `username's VC`. The name can be changed any time with `/vc name`.

---

### `/shopadd` — Position Option Added

A new optional `position` field on `/shopadd` lets you place new items at a specific slot in the shop list rather than always appending to the end. Example: `position: 5` inserts the item at slot 5 and shifts everything else down.

---

### `/vc setup` — Restricted to Bot Owner

`/vc setup` was previously gated on **Manage Server** permission. It is now restricted to the **bot owner only**, preventing any server administrator from changing the VC category.

---

### `/vc` — Public "No Custom VC" Error for Non-Owners

Members who run any `/vc` command without owning a Custom VC now receive a public embed (visible to everyone in the channel) explaining they need to buy one. The embed shows the price, that no previous tier is required, and reminds them to use `/buy Custom VC` with an optional channel name.

`/vc help`, `/vc host`, and `/vc setup` are unaffected — they work for anyone as before.

---

### `/vc help` — Now Posts Publicly

`/vc help` no longer sends an ephemeral (private) reply. The embed is now posted publicly so everyone in the channel can see it.

---

### `/help` — Custom VC Added as First Category

The **🔊 Custom VC** category has been added to the `/help` dropdown and placed first in the list. The full order is now: Custom VC → Economy → Pets → Fun → Images → Utility → Moderation.

---

### Shop — Footer and Custom VC Description Updated

- Footer wording corrected to "previous **item**" (was "previous tier")
- Custom VC shop description now shows **No previous tier required.** in bold to make it clear it can be purchased at any time without unlocking prior tiers

---

## Session — March 18, 2026

### Command Consolidation (Slash Command Slot Reduction)

Discord limits bots to **100 slash commands**. This session focused on merging related commands under shared parent commands to free up space for future features. The bot went from **95 → 82 commands**, freeing **18 open slots**.

---

### `/post` — Merged announcement commands

**Replaces:** `/update`, `/announce`, `/botupdates`
**Saves:** 2 command slots

All three posting commands have been merged into a single `/post` command with subcommands. The full multi-step flow (channel picker → ping picker → modal) is unchanged for each type.

| Old Command | New Command |
|---|---|
| `/update` | `/post update` |
| `/announce` | `/post announce` |
| `/botupdates` | `/post botupdates` |

**Additional change:** `/post announce` now includes a 🔔 Get Announcement Pings role toggle button on posted embeds, matching the behaviour of `/post update` and `/post botupdates`.

> Existing role toggle buttons on previously posted embeds continue to work — no posts were broken.

---

### `/pet` — Merged pet system commands

**Replaces:** `/petshop`, `/adopt`, `/petstatus`, `/feed`, `/play`, `/petname`, `/release`
**Saves:** 6 command slots

All seven pet commands are now subcommands under `/pet`. All cooldowns, logic, and embeds are identical — only the names changed.

| Old Command | New Command |
|---|---|
| `/petshop` | `/pet shop` |
| `/adopt <pet>` | `/pet adopt <pet>` |
| `/petstatus` | `/pet status` |
| `/feed` | `/pet feed` |
| `/play` | `/pet play` |
| `/petname <name>` | `/pet name <name>` |
| `/release` | `/pet release` |

---

### `/coins` — Merged coin admin commands

**Replaces:** `/addcoins`, `/removecoins`
**Saves:** 1 command slot

| Old Command | New Command | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `/addcoins <user> <amount>` | `/coins add <user> <amount>` | Bot Owner only |
| `/removecoins <user> <amount>` | `/coins remove <user> <amount>` | Bot Owner only |

> `/coins remove` was also upgraded this session — it was previously ManageGuild permission and is now restricted to bot owner only, matching `/coins add`.

---

### `/warn` — Merged warning commands

**Replaces:** `/warn`, `/warnings`, `/clearwarnings`
**Saves:** 2 command slots

| Old Command | New Command | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `/warn <user> <reason>` | `/warn add <user> <reason>` | Moderate Members |
| `/warnings <user>` | `/warn view <user>` | Moderate Members |
| `/clearwarnings <user>` | `/warn clear <user>` | Administrator |

---

### `/bot` — Merged bot info commands

**Replaces:** `/botinfo`, `/ping`, `/uptime`
**Saves:** 2 command slots

| Old Command | New Command |
|---|---|
| `/botinfo` | `/bot info` |
| `/ping` | `/bot ping` |
| `/uptime` | `/bot uptime` |

---

### Bug Fix — Announcement ping button

The `/post announce` command was missing the role toggle button that `/post update` and `/post botupdates` had. Added `🔔 Get Announcement Pings` button which toggles the Announcements ping role for the member who clicks it.

---
